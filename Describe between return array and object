Describe between return array and object:-
Arrays:
1.	Ordered List: Arrays are ordered lists of values. Each element in an array has a numerical index starting from 0.	Key-Value 
2.	Homogeneous Data: Arrays typically store homogeneous data, meaning that all elements are of the same data type.	
3.	Methods: Arrays come with built-in methods for common operations like adding, removing, and manipulating elements. 
    For example, you can use push to add elements to the end of an array or pop to remove the last element.
4.	Iteration: Arrays are easily iterable using loops, making it convenient to perform operations on each element.

Objects:
1. Pairs: Objects are collections of key-value pairs. The keys are strings or symbols, and the values can be of any data type.
2. Unordered: Unlike arrays, objects are unordered. The order of key-value pairs is not guaranteed.
3. Heterogeneous Data: Objects can store heterogeneous data, meaning that the values associated with different keys can be of different data types.
4. Dot Notation: You can access values in an object using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).
